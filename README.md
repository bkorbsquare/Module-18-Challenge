## Description

- This code displays a Social Network API.
- I wanted to create and test the API routes on the back end of a Social Network application.
- I coded JavaScript using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Moment. I tested the API routes with Insomnia (although I would prefer an in-editor extension like Thunder Client).
- Given more time I would include concise comments, more detailed error messages, and thorough tests.
